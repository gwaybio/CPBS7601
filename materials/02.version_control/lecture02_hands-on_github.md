# Hands-on activity #2:

## Setting up and using GitHub

### Objective:

Learn how to set up a GitHub account, configure SSH keys, fork and clone a repository, and make a pull request.

### Instructions:

1. Download git (if you haven’t already):

   - Follow the instructions here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
   - Note: Windows users might want to use https://gitforwindows.org/

1. Setting up a GitHub account:

   - Visit GitHub.com and sign up for a free account if you don't already have one.
   - Complete your profile by adding a profile picture and a short bio - Create your "brand"!

1. Configuring SSH keys:

   - Generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.
   - Add to your GitHub profile
   - Follow steps outlined here: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

1. Think about folder organization ahead of time:

   - Create a folder somewhere that is easily accessible called `repos`
   - You will then have one dedicated place to clone all of your GitHub repositories
     - You could even add an additional folder structure of "orgs" (e.g., `repos/wayscience/`)

1. Follow sandbox instructions:

   - https://github.com/WayScience/CPBS7601/materials/02.version_control/sandbox
   - Follow Steps 1-7 to add your details to the `students.md` file

1. Let the instructor know when you are finished:

   - The instructor will go over pull request review

1. Review one other pull request:

   - Review the pull request written by the person to your left
   - Follow the procedures the instructor introduced

### Deliverables:

- A GitHub account with profile picture
- A merged pull request into the sandbox

### Tips:

- Follow best practices for commit messages and pull request descriptions.
- Make sure your changes are meaningful and well-documented.
- Review the contributing guidelines of the repository you are contributing to.
